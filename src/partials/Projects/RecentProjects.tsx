          MCStorage was a BaaS (Backup as a Service) I created with a friend.
          It's goal was to integrate easily into Minecraft and other game servers to easily backup data.
          It was sold off in 2022 and is now under new management.
          The frontend was in <em>Reactjs</em>, while the backend consisted of a <em>Fastify</em> server, <em>ZFS</em> storage nodes, and more.
